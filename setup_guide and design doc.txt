You will need node.js version 4.0 or higher to run this code

       node index

To run the test use the command

      mocha ./tests/index.js





The problem solved here is Problem Two: Conference Track Management



I have solved this using the 0/1 knapsack algorithm(with weight being same as benefits)

All the main objects in code are written with getters and setters

There is the Talk object which is used for the creation of talks

There is the Sessions Object used for adding talks to sessions

The track object used for adding sessions to tracks

conference management object used for managing all the tracks

data is configurable and is present in config.js file

This is basically a node module that I have created that can be used by other induviduals as well 


The code reads an input file named input.txt which is having all the data of the talks ,it then computes the output and prints it in command line

you can see the screenshots of the same in screens folder provided with the code
